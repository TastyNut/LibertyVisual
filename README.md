# Liberty Visual

This modification of GTA IVs graphics and textures aims to make the game as realistic looking as possible. <br>
It achieves this through utilizing [ENB](http://enbdev.com/download.html) and [ReShade](https://reshade.me). <br>

This mod was created by [Orange Brains](https://github.com/TastyNut/LibertyVisual/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#credits), who hasn't shown a sign of activity since september of 2022. <br>
The remaining team behind Liberty Visual decided to finish the mod and release it in the fall of 2024. <br>

## Mod Features

### Graphics

- timecycle created from scratch to achieve a realistic look based on the real NYC

through ENB:
- Skylighting

through ReShade:
- Ambient Oclusion
- Screen-Space Reflections
- Ambient Light

#### ReShade Settings
There are 4 different configs for ReShade.
- "LOW" is the config you should use if your Vanilla Game already struggles to run at 1080p/60FPS
- "default" is meant to be Playable on fairly modern Hardware at 4K with a fluid framerate.
- "HIGH" is the Screenshot Preset for higher end machines, stable frame rates be gone.
- "MAX" is the best you can get out of ReShade. You probably need a NASA-Machine to have your game even launch with this!

### Textures
- overhauled various textures to be higher in quality - [see here](https://flic.kr/s/aHskQKJgMY)
- added parallax mapping to various textures - [see here](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmMxWVVi)
