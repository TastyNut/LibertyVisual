# Liberty Visual

This Modification of GTA IVs Graphics and Textures aims to make the Game as Realistic Looking as possible. <br>
It achieves this through utilizing [ENB](http://enbdev.com/download.html) and [ReShade](https://reshade.me). <br>

This mod was created by [Orange Brains](https://youtube.com/orangebrains), who hasn't shown a sign of activity since September of 2022. <br>
The remaining Team behind Liberty Visual decided to finish the Mod and release it in the Fall of 2024. <br>
