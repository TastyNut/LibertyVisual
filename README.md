# Liberty Visual

This modification of GTA IVs graphics and textures aims to make the game as realistic looking as possible. <br>
It achieves this through utilizing [ENB](http://enbdev.com/download.html) and [ReShade](https://reshade.me). <br>

This mod was created by [Orange Brains](https://github.com/TastyNut/LibertyVisual/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#credits), who hasn't shown a sign of activity since september of 2022. <br>
The remaining team behind Liberty Visual decided to finish the mod and release it in the fall of 2024. <br>
